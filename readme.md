# Task List (IBM Skillsbuild Intro Project)

As an introduction to basic web dev, learners are given an interactive project using the base three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea of the project is that, as a new developer, you are given the task to create a page for employees to be able to keep track of tasks assigned to them.

The requirements given are:
* User must be able to input a task
* User must be able to add a task with the Enter key or by clicking a button
* User's task must appear structured
* User must be able to check off completed tasks
* User should have a visual confirmation when a task is completed
* User must be shown an error message if they do not enter a task correctly
* Company brand guidelines must be followed
* Task list page must be visually appealing and functional on desktop and mobile devices

This project was initially set up using the CodeSwing VSCode extension.
